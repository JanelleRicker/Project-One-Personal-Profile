        <h2>I run.</h2>
        <p>Once in an interview I responded to a question about how I handle stress with two words - "I run." As I look back, I can only hope I clarified that statement by explaining that I was refering to physical exercise. Years have passed since I gave that two word answer. I traded running in a small Ohio town for running the hills of Pennslvania. Now I run my west Indianapolis neighbor. I've had a fracture in my ankle. My running partner had to quit because of reconstructive surgery to his foot.</p>
        <p>Things have changed. But I still want those two words to be true - I run.</p>

        <h2>I design.</h2>
        <p>I enjoy creating in variety of media. Whether I have my foot on the pedal of my sewing machine, a paint brush in my hand, or my eyes on a computer screen, I love to design. Check out the Designs page to see some of my digital work.</p>
        <p>The digital world continues to grow and define how we do business and see the world. I would like add my voice to the digital design chorus. That's why I'm learning to create websites.</p>
        <p>One day I hope to use the two words above to describe my occupation. I can hear it now. "So Janelle, what do you do?" "I design."</p>

        <h2>I enjoy.</h2>
        <p>Other things I enjoy include serving with my church family, camping, board games, reading historic non-fiction, and movies.</p>
